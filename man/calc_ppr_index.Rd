\title{Calculate the PPR index}
\usage{
calc_ppr_index(
  catch,
  speciesTL,
  transferEfficiency = 0.1,
  speciesCode = "NESPP3"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{catch}{Data frame. n x m Data containing the total catch (g) by each species in each year.
Must include two columns named YEAR,catch, a third column must contain the NESPP3 codes}

\item{speciesTL}{Data frame. m x anything. Species codes and trophic level for the most abundantly caught species.
One column must be named NESPP3 and another Troph}

\item{transferEfficiency}{Numeric scalar. The value of transfer efficiency to use in the PPR calculation. Range should be [0,1] (Default = 0.10)}

\item{speciesCode}{Character string. The name of the column that holds the species codes. Default = "NESPP3".}
}
\value{
Data frame:

\item{YEAR}{Year of the index}
\item{INDEX}{Value of the index}
}
